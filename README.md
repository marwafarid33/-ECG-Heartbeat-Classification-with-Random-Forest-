# ECG Heartbeat Classification with Random Forest 💓

This project demonstrates a **machine learning pipeline** to classify heartbeat signals from the MIT-BIH dataset using **Random Forest**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automatic class imbalance handling** with `class_weight="balanced"`.  
- **Train/Validation/Test split** for reliable evaluation.  
- **Evaluation metrics**: Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, Balanced Accuracy.  
- **Visualizations** of class distribution and confusion matrices.  

## 🩺 Motivation
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide.  
This project is a practical example of **AI in healthcare**, predicting heart conditions from ECG signals.
